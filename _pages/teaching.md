<b>Case Study Developer/Writer (2011-2012)</b>

I collaborated with the UC Global Health Institute's One Health Center of Expertise at UC Davis to develop case studies for a multi-campus UC-wide One Health course, the goal of which was to promote an integrated, transdisciplinary approach to global health issues. Each case study incorporated human, environment, and animal health, as well as broad public health and epidemiological concepts along with multiple choice and open-ended questions. Case studies written include Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever: Humans, Animals, and Vectors; and Ecotourism and Mountain Gorillas: A Rwandan Case Study. 



<b>Healthcare Programs Director (2009)</b>

I served as the inaugural Healthcare Programs Director for Village Hopecore International, a microfinance nonprofit dedicated to fostering community empowerment and growth. While living in Chogoria, Kenya, I developed and oversaw healthcare programs for loan recipients, including a malaria education and prevention program; distributed over 1,000 mosquito nets to loan recipients and families, conducted interviews of over 100 loan recipients to collect epidemiological data for future health programs; and acted as health advocate and liaison between hospital and loan recipients. 

 
<b>National Managing and Recruitment Director (2008-2009)</b>

While a student at Stanford University, I worked at FACE AIDS, a student-run national nonprofit dedicated to mobilizing and inspiring students to fight AIDS in Africa. As the National Managing Director, I provided operational support to the Executive Director and managed programmatic teamsâ€™ operations, including: development, recruiting, programming, national events, education, and chapter relations. I also recruited over 70 new high school and college chapters as Recruitment Director.
